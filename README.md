# Introduction
ASELSD is a novel selective ensemble learning protocol that first speculates the performances of different base models for various test samples based on sample correlations, and then adaptively selects the base models for ensemble. This protocol is applied to plant miRNA-lncRNA interaction prediction and shows improvement performance over the previous work and strong competitiveness compared with existing methods. It also has strong adaptability and expansibility for more research fields.
